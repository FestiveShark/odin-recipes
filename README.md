# odin-recipes
Recipes project within The Odin Project curriculum

This project serves to showcase what I've learned in the HTML Foundations
section of the Foundations course. Upon completion, it should be clear that I
understand the basics of HTML coding and am capable of creating a basic site,
with basic styling, proper formatting and working links and images.
